## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Axios, Framer Motion

**Server:** Node.js, Express.js

**Database:** MongoDB

**Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)

## Features

- Shorten long URLs.
- Track the number of clicks on each shortened URL.

- Stylish frontend design with animations and a deep blue dark theme.
